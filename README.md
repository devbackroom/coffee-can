# coffee-can

INTRODUCTION
------------
The coffee-can.numbers spreadsheet is a simple numbers spreadsheet tracking my crypto assets for long term investment. The "Coffee Can" idea comes from a book I read called 100 Baggers by Christopher Mayer. This spreadsheet could easily be converted to an excel or google sheet. I plan to turn this into an app so this is the bare bones of that.

INSTALLATION
------------
Copy the script named coffee_can.applescript into your scripts folder at /Users/your_username/Library/Scripts/Applications/Numbers
